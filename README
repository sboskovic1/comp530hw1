Notes: 
Might want to change how pinned pages work in buffer manager, would be much more complex but technically I think we should 
not actually allocate a page until the page tries to write, but this would be really complicated. Maybe ask on piazza.

Need to clarify exactly what constitutes as a "use." This creates a problem when unpinning a page, as when putting back in 
the LRU cache it might not necessarily have been "used" more recently than anything there. This would require keeping some sort of clock,
but if unpinning counts as a use we can proceed as expected. Might also not even matter since I'm not sure how they would even test 
whether a page is in the buffer.
